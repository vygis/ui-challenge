# UI Exercise

## Introduction
***

This repository has been constructed for developers to demonstrate their UI/Web development skills based off a given specification.

The idea by performing this exercise you will be able to demonstrate several aspects of your coding practice:

* Ability to use GIT source control
* Ability to work with Bootstrap
* Ability to develop from a detailed specification
* Ability to use LESS to produce CSS stylesheets

## Problem Statement
***
In this dummy example we have a specification ('/specification/UI_Task_Guide') of a splash page for a mock demonstration system.  In this exercise we would like you to produce the styling and layout to produce a web page which matches the specification provided.

We've provided a stub Grunt project should you wish to use this to help get you started; however the mandatory requirement here is that the layout is performed utilising Bootstrap and you use a LESS generated stylesheet for styling.

Images required ('app/images') and text content ('/specification/Page_Text') for the page have been provided.
	
	
## Instructions
***
We're not imposing a maximum or minimum time limit on this challenge but previous experience suggests allowing for around an hour to complete.

1. Clone this repository
2. Create your own GitHub/BitBucket repository and commit the base project to it
3. At regular intervals commit and push your changes so we can see logical progress
4. Add a text file (ideally in Markdown format) to the root of the repository detailing the changes you made and explanations for the steps you took.  Feel free to include any assumptions you made during the exercise too.
5. Notify us that you have completed the exercise

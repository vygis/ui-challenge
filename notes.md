#Notes

* the background image file has not been provided. I've used a stock image off the internet instead.
* company logo image has not been provided either. Text with a large font size used instead.
* I wasn't entirely sure what the underlined 'on' and 'off' text specified (page 9 in the guide pdf). I assumed they represented link formatting.
* Small screen responsiveness is somewhat rudimentary (the panel columns stack up) due to lack of precise specs and time constraints.
